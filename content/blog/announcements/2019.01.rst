    The release notes accidentally forgot to mention
    `Gradle-less Android builds <#android-development-but-without-the-pain>`_.
    That's fixed now. Besides that, Hunter, Homebrew and Vcpkg packages for
    2019.01 are now ready.

`Tweakable constants for live coding`_
======================================

While Magnum supported code hot-reload through its :dox:`PluginManager` library
from the very beginning, now there's a new, much faster --- but also more
restricted --- counterpart to it. In the context of live coding, 90% iterations
is done *on the data*, fiddling with values until they *feel right*. Even
waiting few seconds for code to recompile after each such iteration is still
very time-consuming and often the process is abruptly ended when the value is
"good enough". So, what if we wouldn't need to recompile?

:dox:`Utility::Tweakable` is responsible for all the magic shown in the above
video and the gist of it is an ability to update a running application with
constants from modified source code --- without recompilation. The video also
shows an advanced IDE integration with a color picker, however the basic
approach of code changes being reflected
:abbr:`immediately <basically the next frame, so under 16 ms>` works with any
editor.

This feature is still very experimental, on the roadmap is a support for hot
code reload and tweakable constants under Emscripten and on Android, we also
plan on releasing IDE integration plugins similar to the one above once they
reach a more mature state.

`Dear ImGui integration is now official`_
=========================================

Integration of :gh:`Dear ImGui <ocornut/imgui>` into Magnum started as a
community project and got so widely used with multiple forked versions that it
made sense to turn it into an officially maintained library. It's now available
as :dox:`ImGuiIntegration`, part of the
:gh:`magnum-integration <mosra/magnum-integration>` repository. The
corresponding example is integrated as well and has a WebGL 2 version
available:

.. container:: m-row

    .. container:: m-col-m-6 m-push-m-3

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [imgui]
            :end-before: [/imgui]

Instead of having the Dear ImGui sources bundled with Magnum, there's a new
:gh:`FindImGui.cmake <mosra/magnum-integration/blob/master/modules/FindImGui.cmake>`
module that takes care of finding the sources and compiling them as part of
:dox:`ImGuiIntegration`. That gives you the possibility of always being on
exactly the version (or a fork) you need and the flexibility to bundle it your
own way. Some packaging systems (such as Vcpkg) provide Dear ImGui as a
library, that's supported too.

`Animation easings library`_
============================

The animation library, which debuted in the 2018.10 release, received a
collection of various easing functions to add life to your animations. To
provide a complete and correct reference for not just Magnum users, the
functions are also well-documented, with a corresponding math equation, plot
and the equivalent Bézier representation, if it exists. See the :dox:`Animation::Easing` namespace for yourself. Usage is straighforward ---
simply modify the interpolation factor parameter with them:

.. code:: c++

    Vector3 result = Math::lerp(a, b, Animation::Easing::bounceIn(t));

.. image:: {static}/img/blog/announcements/2019.01/easing.png
    :alt: Animation::Easing documentation
    :scale: 50%

`Android development, but without the pain`_
============================================

Contrary to popular belief, neither Android Studio nor Gradle is required to
develop apps for Android. With 2019.01, there's a new CMake macro :cmake:`android_create_apk()` that allows you to create an APK directly from
CMake, without needing to touch Gradle at all:

.. code:: cmake

    find_package(Magnum REQUIRED AndroidApplication)

    add_library(my-application SHARED MyApp.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(my-application PRIVATE
        Magnum::Magnum
        Magnum::Application)

    android_create_apk(my-application AndroidManifest.xml)

As a bonus, using this macro also adds a new build target which allows you to
build, install, package, sign and deploy an APK to a device with a single
command --- for example when using Ninja:

.. code:: shell-session

    $ ninja my-application-deploy
    [5/5] Installing my-application.apk
    Success

This functionality is currently experimental and very limited, but it can save
you several seconds on each deploy compared to equivalent workflow using
Gradle. See the *very extensive* :dox:`Android building docs <platforms-android>`
for more information.

`Dropping GCC 4.7 and CMake 2.8.12 support`_
============================================

With Ubuntu 14.04 going away *even* on Travis CI, it was a time to say goodbye
to compatibility with the old CMake 2.8.12. However, version 3.0 had some
issues with imported targets, so the minimal required version is now 3.1. All
sufficiently modern Linux distributions (except Debian Jessie) are already on
versions past 3.1, so this should not be a problem --- and if not, you can
always download and use an official CMake binary on affected systems.

While at it, support for GCC 4.7 was dropped as well, since this is the last
compiler that didn't support rvalue overloads for :cpp:`this`. Minimal version
is now 4.8.1, since 4.8 is still used on CentOS 7 and we don't want to prevent
Magnum from being used on server side as well.

As far as C++ standard goes, Magnum is going to stay on C++11 for the
foreseeable future. Except for extended :cpp:`constexpr`, neither C++14 nor
C++17 offers anything that would lead to significant improvements on the
library side and the minor advantages are not worth the compile time slowdowns
due to `increase in STL header bloat <https://twitter.com/czmosra/status/1085993965529255936>`_.
However, Magnum is not forbidding *you* to jump to newer C++ standards --- if
you need the recent features, feel free to use them.

`Ongoing compile-time and binary size improvements`_
====================================================

Speaking of STL header bloat, and not entirely unrelated to the recent outrage
about "The State Of C++", Magnum is undergoing a general update that aims for
shortened compile times and smaller binary sizes, especially in WebAssembly
builds. Right now, this is mainly about reducing the amount of STL includes in
headers and because :s:`not all` basically no STL containers can be easily
forward-declared, it means replacing them with custom alternatives.

As not all updates can be made in a backwards-compatible way, the change is
happening gradually --- this release replaces most uses of
:dox:`std::unique_ptr` and :dox:`std::reference_wrapper` with
:dox:`Containers::Pointer` and :dox:`Containers::Reference` in order to avoid
heavy ``<memory>`` and ``<functional>`` includes and the work will continue in
future releases.

.. block-success:: Is it worth the bother?

    While header bloat is not the only thing contributing to long compile
    times, it's responsible for quite a large portion --- and is thus also the
    "low hanging fruit" when it comes to compile time optimizations. There's
    still a lot do in the Magnum codebase and while removing the dependency on ``<memory>`` and ``<functional>`` is currently not resulting in any
    significant compile-time speed up when building Magnum itself, projects
    using Magnum reported compile times being shorter by 20--30% as a result of
    this change.

As with all other design decisions in Magnum, this doesn't mean the engine will
now unconditionally *force* you to use some alien types. Instead, you have a
choice --- if you feel more comfortable using standard types, your team is not
ready to learn yet another API or you're interacting with a 3rd party lib that
uses them anyway, just keep using them, the new Magnum pointer and reference
types are implicitly convertible to and from the STL equivalents. On the other
hand, if you really care about your compile times and debug performance, the
new types are for you --- and you're encouraged to use them elsewhere as well,
not just when interacting with Magnum.

.. note-primary::

    More details and reasoning behind the new pointer and reference types
    is provided `in a dedicated article <{filename}/blog/backstage/lightweight-stl-compatible-unique-pointer.rst>`_.

`Single-header versions of Magnum APIs`_
========================================

A related ongoing project, which is basically a side-product of the above
"header diet" work, is availability of various Magnum APIs as single-header
libraries --- with a focus on ease of integration, fast compile times and small
file sizes, while inheriting >99% test coverage and extensive documentation
that's own to the Magnum project itself.

Combining all that is only possible because the functionality is primarily
maintained, documented and tested as part of Magnum, where it can make use of
all the infrastructure and tooling. Selected functionality is then extracted
:dox:`via a script <acme>` that strips it of comments, verbose documentation
blocks and rarely used functionality. The result is a small self-contained
file, however still with the confidence of all code paths being properly tested
and documented.

The :gh:`magnum-singles <mosra/magnum-singles>` repository is a new home for
the single-header versions of various Magnum APIs. At the moment the following
low-level containers are present:

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

====================== === ================ ======================================
Library                LoC Preprocessed LoC Description
====================== === ================ ======================================
`CorradeOptional.h`_   328 2742             See :dox:`Containers::Optional` docs
`CorradePointer.h`_    259 2321             See :dox:`Containers::Pointer` docs
`CorradeReference.h`_  115 1639             See :dox:`Containers::Reference` docs
`CorradeScopeGuard.h`_ 108 26               See :dox:`Containers::ScopeGuard` docs
====================== === ================ ======================================

More libraries are to come as the header cleanup advances further. The general
rule for exposing a feature as a single-header library is how much it inflates
*after preprocessing* --- currently the soft upper limit is 10k lines. For
comparison, not even the ``<string>`` header fits in there, as it has 12k; on
the other hand I'm pretty confident I can squeeze the whole :dox:`Math` library
under this limit.

`Vulkan++`_
===========

.. TODO: ugh doxygen you stupid $&@!

As another small piece of the Vulkan puzzle, the new
:dox:`Magnum/Vk/Integration.h </home/mosra/Code/magnum/src/Magnum/Vk/Integration.h>`
header provides conversion between basic Vulkan types and their equivalents
from the :dox:`Math` library, together with :dox:`enum translation </home/mosra/Code/magnum/src/Magnum/Vk/Enums.h>`
contributing to a smoother interaction with raw Vulkan code.

.. code:: c++

    VkOffset2D a{64, 32};
    Vector2i b(a);

    using namespace Math::Literals;
    VkClearColorValue c = VkClearColorValue(0x5297d7_srgbf);

Since Magnum now provides math integration for quite a few libraries, including
ImGui, there's :dox:`a full list <types-thirdparty-integration>` providing
detailed information about available conversions for every third-party API.

`Quality-of-Life improvements in the documentation`_
====================================================

The Magnum documentation received a larger update, mainly related to search
functionality. It's now also showing the corresponding :cpp:`#include` for each
API --- and that's not just classes, but also free functions, types and
single-file namespaces. `Details in this article. <{filename}/blog/meta/improved-doxygen-documentation-and-search.rst>`_

.. image:: {static}/img/blog/meta/improved-doxygen-documentation-and-search/includes.png
    :alt: Include information for free namespace members
    :scale: 50%

`Hunter, MSYS2 and Conan packages`_
===================================

Thanks to our dedicated community, Corrade, Magnum and Magnum Plugins now have
`MSYS2 <https://www.msys2.org/>`_ packages. These are based off the ArchLinux
``PKGBUILD``\ s (since both use ``pacman`` as the package manager) and there's
both a in-source package, building the currently checked out working tree; and
a stable one, downloading a release tarball.

Apart from MSYS2, Magnum is now available in both `Conan <https://conan.io/>`_
and `Hunter <https://hunter.sh/>`_ package managers. While Hunter is
CMake-based and works directly from inside the CMake build directory without
any additional dependencies, Conan is buildsystem-independent, but requires you
to install the Conan client first. Note that while Corrade for Conan is already
there, the Magnum package is :gh:`still work-in-progress <mosra/magnum#304>`.

Homebrew and Vcpkg packages are already on the latest version, ArchLinux
packages are scheduled to be updated soon.

`Updating from previous versions`_
==================================

If you build Magnum with :dox:`BUILD_DEPRECATED <MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED>`
enabled (the default), most of the above-mentioned changes related to
:dox:`std::unique_ptr`, :dox:`std::reference_wrapper` etc. should not result in
any source-breaking changes --- standard types used in your code will still
work as before. However, due to the general header cleanup, you might end up
with a bunch of "incomplete type" errors, as definitons formerly transitively
included from other headers won't be present anymore. In particular, due to
removal of long-deprecated features, the :dox:`Containers::Optional` type is
now only forward-declared in all importer plugin APIs, and similarly it is with
:dox:`Containers::Reference`, so you may need to add some of these to your
codebases:

.. code:: c++

    #include <Corrade/Containers/Optional.h>
    #include <Corrade/Containers/Reference.h>

In order to keep your code forward compatible, the rule should be to always
explicitly include all types that you use in the particular source file and not
rely on the definitions being present due to internal engine header structure.
In practice this is quite hard to achieve, on the other hand due to the
evolving nature of the library, there's not much Magnum itself can do to
prevent such breakages.

This version also starts to remove APIs deprecated in 2018.02 (the first
release after three years without stable updates), meaning if you still have
codebases that are from before this version, these will definitely not work
anymore. The recommended upgrade path is, as always, going through the stable
versions one-by-one and fixing errors and deprecation warnings as they appear
--- jumping straight to latest won't be nowhere near a smooth upgrade
experience.

For a complete overview of newly deprecated features and possible compatibility
breakages, check the changelogs listed below.

`Complete changelog`_
=====================

There's many more little things --- improved :cpp:`constexpr` support for array
view classes, new importer plugin for AAC audio files, ability to switch to the
standard C :cpp:`assert()` macro for assertions etc. See the full changelogs
