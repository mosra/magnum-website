:summary: The new Magnum milestone brings WebGL 2.0 and WebAssembly, VR
    support, lots of niceties for Windows users, iOS port, new experimental UI
    library, improved testing capabilities, support for over 80 new asset
    formats, new examples and much more.

With nearly three years of development since the previous release, I'm excited
to announce the release of Magnum 2018.02. Lots of things happened, so I'll
focus on the most prominent features, for a detailed list follow the changelog
links at the end. This release also introduces a new versioning scheme.
Originally this was meant to be 1.0, but after much thought I decided to go
with year/month instead, as it fits more into the rolling release philosophy of
Magnum.

`Brand new website and documentation theme`_
============================================

Until very recently, Magnum lacked a central place with consistent design for
showcasing the features, providing documentation and keeping you updated. You
can read more in the `website announcement <{filename}/blog/meta/a-new-website-coming-soon.rst>`_
post, be sure to also subscribe to `the blog Atom feed <https://blog.magnum.graphics/feeds/all.atom.xml>`_
to not miss any updates. The documentation got an overhaul in a similar style,
with extra effort put into being fast, easy-to-read and with first-class search
functionality. There's a blog post dedicated to
`explaining how the new search works <{filename}/blog/meta/implementing-a-fast-doxygen-search.rst>`_,
if you want to learn about the inner workings.

One notable non-obvious feature is an ability to search using OpenGL or OpenAL
API names --- very handy in case you are porting existing OpenGL code to
Magnum:

.. image:: {static}/img/blog/announcements/2018.02/opengl-search.png
    :alt: OpenGL symbol search
    :target: https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/#search

Magnum wouldn't be anything without the great community that formed around it
and community involvement is important also for the website content --- if you
want to share a succes story with Magnum or have something interesting to say,
`submit a Guest Post <{filename}/blog/meta/introducing-guest-posts.rst>`_ and
we'll be happy to publish it.

If you didn't notice yet, there's also a `Magnum chat room on Gitter.im <https://gitter.im/mosra/magnum>`_,
full of people that are happy to help if you have questions or need a bit of
support. You can join simply with your GitHub or Twitter account.

`First-class WebGL 2.0 support, WebAssembly`_
=============================================

An area that received great care is the WebGL port. WebGL 2.0 is now fully
supported and there is a set of new dependency-less plugins so you can now more
easily play audio, convert images or render text on the web. The
:dox:`StbImageConverter <Trade::StbImageConverter>` and :dox:`StbTrueTypeFont <Text::StbTrueTypeFont>`
plugins are one of them. The :dox:`BulletIntegration` code and example now
runs on the web and the :dox:`magnum-info <magnum-gl-info>` /
:dox:`magnum-al-info` utilities were ported to provide information about your
WebGL implementation as well.

.. container:: m-row m-container-inflate

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [bullet]
            :end-before: [/bullet]

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [gl-info]
            :end-before: [/gl-info]

A bunch of code size optimizations is already in place and further size
improvements are on the roadmap. Compilation to WebAssembly for better
performance is now possible, which in fact replaced the unmaintained NaCl port.
See the `post about WebAssembly support <{filename}/blog/announcements/webassembly-support-and-more.rst>`_
for more information.

`Virtual Reality, WebVR`_
=========================

Thanks to *years* of hard work by :gh:`Squareys`, Magnum now provides seamless
integration of the Oculus VR SDK in the :dox:`OvrIntegration` library, together
with a simple example that :dox:`showcases a basic use <examples-ovr>`. Besides
that, there's a live example showing WebVR integration in Emscripten:

.. container:: m-row m-container-inflate

    .. container:: m-col-m-6 m-push-m-3

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [webvr]
            :end-before: [/webvr]

`Windows improvements`_
=======================

`Visual Studio 2015, 2017, Windows Store/Phone, ANGLE, Vcpkg`_
--------------------------------------------------------------

Windows support did a huge leap forward compared to the previous version.
Thanks to big improvements in C++11 support in recent Visual Studio versions
it's now possible to build Magnum with MSVC 2015 and 2017 and also target the
UWP platform using the `ANGLE <https://github.com/google/angle>`_ OpenGL-to-D3D
translation layer. On the other hand, support for MSVC 2013 and MinGW32 (the
non-w64 version) was dropped to simplify maintenance efforts.

To make development and dependency handling on Windows even easier, Magnum now
has `Vcpkg <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg>`_ packages, which allow you to
install it together with all dependencies using a single command:

.. code:: bat

    vcpkg install magnum

Packages installed using Vcpkg can be used straight away in Visual Studio ---
all you need to do is to :cpp:`#include` the headers you want, the buildsystem
will do all needed library linking and setup behind the scenes automatically.
*(Cool, isn't it?)*

It's of course also possible to use Vcpkg-installed packages with CMake. See
:dox:`the documentation <building-packages-vcpkg>` for details.

`UTF-8 everywhere`_
-------------------

Among other notable things is improved Unicode support on Windows. In line with
the `UTF-8 Manifesto <https://utf8everywhere.org/>`_, all Magnum APIs were
designed to expect strings and paths encoded in UTF-8. This is now working
properly also on Windows --- as long as you use Magnum APIs such as
:dox:`Utility::Directory` or :dox:`Trade::AbstractImporter` to access the
filesystem, Windows wide-char APIs will be used behind the scenes to ensure
proper path encoding.

`macOS improvements, iOS port`_
===============================

Magnum is being used in a project that's tightly coupled to Apple platforms,
which means the code now runs on iOS as well. :dox:`Platform::Sdl2Application`
was updated for Retina support and other iOS-specific features.

There's also a new :dox:`Platform::WindowlessIosApplication` that's useful for
running headless OpenGL tests on iOS. The :dox:`TestSuite` library now provides
integration with Xcode and XCTest so you can run tests directly from the IDE.
The :dox:`corrade_add_test() <corrade-cmake-add-test>` macro is also able to do
all the necessary boilerplate to allow you to run your tests directly on an iOS
device or simulator simply by running CMake ``ctest`` from the command-line.

To make life easier for macOS users, there are now Homebrew packages that you
can install simply by typing

.. code:: sh

    brew install mosra/magnum/magnum

You can also add all Magnum packages as a tap, see :dox:`the documentation <building-packages-brew>`
for more information.

.. note-info::

    We're fully aware of Apple decision to abandon OpenGL support and pushing
    for Metal instead. This will be, along with Vulkan, among the main topics
    for the following Magnum releases.

`Broader testing capabilities`_
===============================

Magnum was involved in a project that was all about processing of image and
spatial data. Thanks to that, the :dox:`TestSuite` library received loads of
improvements to make automated testing a breeze. The test output is now colored
to make it easier to spot failures and it gained
:dox:`benchmarking capabilities <TestSuite-Tester-benchmark>` so you can
compare how your algorithms perform against baseline implementations --- using
CPU time, wall clock time, instruction counter or any custom measured quantity
such as amount of allocated memory.

.. include:: 2018.02/benchmark.ansi
    :code: ansi

Besides the already mentioned iOS testing, there are similar improvements for
Android --- the :dox:`corrade_add_test() <corrade-cmake-add-test>` can employ
``adb`` to upload the test executable together with all bundled files to a
device or emulator, run it there and retrieve the results just as if you would
be running the tests on your local machine.

The test suite is now able to handle :dox:`instanced tests <TestSuite-Tester-instanced>`
(or, in other words, data-driven tests). Lots of attention was put into fuzzy
comparison --- from simple numeric comparison using :dox:`TestSuite::Compare::Around`
to comparing image data to a ground truth with error thresholds using
:dox:`DebugTools::CompareImage`. Because proper visualization of large data is
essential for productivity, the latter is able to print ASCII art visualization
of the difference so you can see what's wrong directly from your CI log:

.. include:: 2018.02/compareimage.ansi
    :code: ansi

Base class for tests requiring OpenGL context is now available in a dedicated
:dox:`OpenGLTester <GL::OpenGLTester>` library and it gained support for
:dox:`GPU time benchmarks <GL-OpenGLTester-benchmarks>`. For easier testing on
OpenGL ES and WebGL, there are now :dox:`DebugTools::bufferSubData()` and
:dox:`DebugTools::textureSubImage()` helper utilities that supplement the lack
of :dox:`Buffer::data() <GL::Buffer::data()>` and
:dox:`Texture::image() <GL::Texture::image()>` on those platforms.

To ensure stability and make maintenance easier, Magnum and all its libraries
are now also compiled and tested with code coverage on all supported platforms
--- see the `Build Status <{filename}/build-status.rst>`_ page for the whole
testing matrix. This also means that every submitted pull request gets
automatically tested for regressions, streamlining the whole review process.

There's much more to mention regarding testing --- it'll be a part of a more
detailed blog post in the future, stay tuned!

`Experimental UI library`_
==========================

Some years ago I was responsible for UI rendering in a project that focused on
visualizing large amounts of textual and plot data. The new experimental
:dox:`Magnum::Ui` library builds on the knowledge gained during that project
and its design goal is being ale to render huge UIs (such as editors) *fast*
while staying fully customizable and easy to use for quick prototyping.

Due to its heavy use of uniform buffers and instancing it's requiring at least
OpenGL ES 3.0 (or WebGL 2.0). The current state is *very experimental* --- it
will gradually stabilize, gain more widgets and get documented in the next
months. You can see how it looks in the UI Widget Gallery, it was also used to
provide some knobs and toggles for the
`Area Lights <{filename}/blog/guest-posts/area-lights-with-ltcs.rst>`_ demo:

.. container:: m-row m-container-inflate

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [ui-gallery]
            :end-before: [/ui-gallery]

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [arealights]
            :end-before: [/arealights]

`Asset management improvements`_
================================

A large new feature is support for compressed images --- loading them from
files, uploading and downloading them from textures; plus there are new
interfaces in :dox:`Trade::AbstractImageConverter` ready for integrating
various GPU compression libraries. Together with compressed images Magnum
gained support for various pixel storage options in the :dox:`PixelStorage`
class to allow direct manipulation of image sub-rectangles, with further
convenience features such as :cpp:`Image::slice()` planned for the next
releases.

There's also a new utility called :dox:`magnum-imageconverter <magnum-imageconverter>`
that simply exposes all existing :dox:`*Importer <Trade::AbstractImporter#derived-classes>`
and :dox:`*ImageConverter <Trade::AbstractImageConverter#derived-classes>`
plugins on a command line. Together with a new :dox:`AnyImageConverter <Trade::AnyImageConverter>`
plugin it's able to autodetect source and destination file formats based on
extension, so you can easily use it in your pipeline for data conversion, for
example:

.. code:: sh

    magnum-imageconverter image.bmp image.png

Many external contributions went into asset management and conversion --- you
can now use the :dox:`AssimpImporter <Trade::AssimpImporter>` plugin to load
about 40 new scene formats using the `Assimp <http://assimp.sourceforge.net/>`_
library; the :dox:`DevIlImageImporter <Trade::DevIlImageImporter>` plugin uses
`DevIL <http://openil.sourceforge.net/>`_ to load 40 new image formats. Initial
work went into camera and light property import, with support in the Assimp and
:dox:`OpenGEX <Trade::OpenGexImporter>` importer.

Among the others there's a possibility to load DXT-compressed textures using
:dox:`DdsImporter <Trade::DdsImporter>` or convert images to PNG and EXR using
:dox:`PngImageConverter <Trade::PngImageConverter>` and
:dox:`MiniExrImageConverter <Trade::MiniExrImageConverter>`. The
:dox:`StbImageConverter <Trade::StbImageConverter>` can now use
:gh:`stb_image_write <nothings/stb>` to output HDR and BMP formats in addition
to PNG.

`Audio library goodies`_
========================

The Audio library received `HRTF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function>`_
support that's very important for immersive audio in VR, besides that it
supports :dox:`many new buffer formats <Audio::BufferFormat>`. The HRTF support
is accompanied with a new example and the whole :dox:`Audio` library was
updated to work on the web as well:

.. container:: m-row m-container-inflate

    .. container:: m-col-m-6 m-push-m-3

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [audio]
            :end-before: [/audio]

Many new dependency-less import plugins were contributed ---
:dox:`StbVorbisAudioImporter <Audio::StbVorbisImporter>` for loading OGG Vorbis
files using :gh:`stb_vorbis <nothings/stb>`, :dox:`DrWavAudioImporter <Audio::DrWavImporter>`
and :dox:`DrFlacAudioImporter <Audio::DrFlacImporter>` for loading WAV and FLAC
files using :gh:`dr_wav/dr_flac <mackron/dr_libs>`. The
:dox:`WavAudioImporter <Audio::WavImporter>` plugin that's maintained directly
in Magnum received various updates, broader buffer format support and better
error handling.

`Full control over initialization and ownership`_
=================================================

While all types in Magnum are by default initialized to a defined value, it's
now possible to override the behavior for greater flexibility. For example
if you will be overwriting all values in a container anyway; to avoid
unnecessary memory zeroing instructions in a tight loop; or to defer OpenGL
object initialization to a point where a context is ready without introducing
additional indirection using pointers or optional objects:

.. code:: c++

    /* Generate grid positions */
    Containers::Array<Vector3> positions{Containers::NoInit, 16*16};
    for(auto& i: positions)
        i = ...;

    /* Zero-init the matrix instead of setting it to identity */
    Matrix3x3 m{Math::ZeroInit};

    /* Defer buffer initialization for later when GL context is ready */
    Buffer buffer{NoCreate};

    // ...

    buffer = Buffer{};

Together with this it's now possible to transfer ownership of all underlying
resources --- wrapping externally allocated arrays and providing custom
deleters, or, on the other hand, using :dox:`Containers::Array::release()` to
release ownership of the allocated memory. There are also two new classes,
:dox:`Containers::StaticArray` and :dox:`Containers::StaticArrayView`, for
handling stack-allocated, compile-time-sized arrays and views on them. New
APIs like :dox:`Containers::arrayCast()` or :dox:`Containers::arraySize()`
provide further convenience utilities:

.. code:: c++

    /* custom allocator functions */
    char* allocate(std::size_t);
    void deallocate(char*, std::size_t);

    // ...

    /* Allocate the data and wrap them in a RAII container */
    Containers::Array<char> data{allocate(128), 128, [](char* data, std::size_t size) {
        deallocate(data, size);
    }};

    /* The allocated array is in fact 16 four-component float vectors */
    Containers::ArrayView<Vector4> vectors = Containers::arrayCast<Vector4>(data);
    for(Vector4& i: vectors)
        // ...

`Math library additions`_
=========================

The :dox:`Math` library received a class representing :dox:`Bezier <Math::Bezier>`
curves and a :dox:`Frustum` structure. The :dox:`Math::Geometry::Intersection`
namespace is extended with frustum culling algorithms and further additions are
already being worked on.

There's a new :dox:`Half` type for representing 16-bit half-float numbers. It's
just a storage type, providing conversions from and to :cpp:`float` types. In
addition to the existing ``_deg``/``_rad`` literals there is a new ``_h``
literal for half-floats and :dox:`various literals <Math::Literals>` for
entering hexadecimal RGB(A) colors in linear RGB or sRGB:

.. code:: c++

    Color3ub a = 0x33b27f_rgb;      // {0x33, 0xb2, 0x7f}
    Color4 c = 0x33b27fcc_srgbaf;   // {0.0331048f, 0.445201f, 0.212231f, 0.8f}

There's much more added for more convenience and better feature parity with
GLSL, check out the complete changelog at the end of the article.

`Better interoperability with 3rd-party code`_
==============================================

One of design goals of Magnum is to be a collection of useful non-intrusive
tools that works well with third-party libraries --- not being a big monolithic
engine that takes over everything and forces a particular workflow. With this
and the following releases this design goal is being pushed further than ever
before.

One common case is that Magnum is not the only library accessing the OpenGL
context --- for example it's only taking care of data visualization in a bigger
application that's written in Qt. Because OpenGL is a lot of global state, care
must be taken so libraries know what state can be trusted and what not ---
that's handled with :dox:`Context::resetState() <GL::Context::resetState()>`.
It's also possible to wrap externally created OpenGL objects using
:dox:`*::wrap() <GL::Buffer::wrap()>` and, conversely, release their ownership
with :dox:`release() <GL::Buffer::release()>`. A reduced example showing
`rendering into QQuickFramebufferObject <https://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/05/11/integrating-custom-opengl-rendering-with-qt-quick-via-qquickframebufferobject/>`_:

.. code:: c++

    #include <Magnum/Context.h>
    #include <Magnum/Framebuffer.h>
    #include <Magnum/Mesh.h>
    #include <Magnum/Shaders/Phong.h>
    #include <QQuickFramebufferObject>

    struct MagnumRenderer: QQuickFramebufferObject::Renderer {
        // ...

        QOpenGLFramebufferObject* createFramebufferObject(const QSize& size) override {
            /* Create Qt framebuffer object and wrap it to use with Magnum APIs */
            auto fb = new QOpenGLFramebufferObject(size, ...);
            _fb = Framebuffer::wrap(fb->handle(), {{}, {size.width(), size.height()}});
            return fb;
        }

        void render() override {
            /* Reset Magnum state tracker after Qt did its job */
            Context::resetState(Context::State::ExitExternal);

            /* Clear the framebuffer and draw a mesh */
            _fb.clear(FramebufferClear::Color|FramebufferClear::Depth);
            _mesh.draw(_shader);

            /* Clean up to avoid Magnum state being modified by Qt */
            Context::resetState(Context::State::EnterExternal);
        }

        Framebuffer _fb{NoInit};
        Mesh _mesh;
        Shaders::Phong _shader;
    };

Sometimes you may need to access the underlying APIs that Magnum is wrapping
--- for example to test out a new feature that hasn't been exposed yet. Both
:dox:`Platform::Sdl2Application` and :dox:`Platform::GlfwApplication` now
provide access to the underlying toolkit structures. If you need to go even
deeper, you can ditch the ``*Application`` classes completely and simply attach
Magnum to an existing OpenGL context. How to do that with GLFW is shown on a
:dox:`simple triangle rendering example <examples-triangle-plain-glfw>`.

Similar thing is with asset importers --- if you need to access particular
Assimp feature directly or parse an OpenGEX extension structure, it's now
available through type-erased ``importerState()`` accessors. In case of Assimp
it's also possible to take over an existing Assimp instance using
:dox:`openState() <Trade::AbstractImporter::openState()>`. See related sections
in :dox:`AssimpImporter <Trade-AssimpImporter-state>` and
:dox:`OpenGexImporter <Trade-OpenGexImporter-state>` plugin documentation for
details.

Conversion of math structures from and to external types was extended to all
structures in the :dox:`Math` namespace, so with proper boilerplate header
included it is possible to have seamless integration with, for example,
`GLM <https://glm.g-truc.net/>`_:

.. code:: c++

    glm::gtc::quaternion a{4.0f, 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f};

    Quaternion q{a};
    Debug{} << q.vector();              // {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}

    glm::gtc::quaternion b{q.normalized()};

`New OpenGL-related functionality`_
===================================

The OpenGL wrapping layer received updates for full compute shader support with
SSBOs and image load/store, there's a new :dox:`TransformFeedback` class and
completed uniform buffer support, among many other things.

Improvements were made to make it possible to have multiple independent
thread-local instances of Magnum, for example in case where one Magnum context
is used as a data processing backend in a background thread and another for
application UI rendering on the main thread.

In order to make debugging easier, it's now possible to blacklist certain
OpenGL extensions or driver workarounds from the command-line and environment.
See :dox:`the documentation for more information <GL-Context-command-line>`.

`Even more new stuff`_
=======================

The list of new things doesn't stop here. It's important to note that all
example code is now :dox:`put into public domain <example-index>` (or
UNLICENSE) to free you from legal obstacles when using the code in your
apps. There's a new example showing how to use :dox:`Parallel Split / Cascaded Shadow Maps <examples-shadows>`
and also a simple Object Picking example:

.. container:: m-row m-container-inflate

    .. container:: m-col-m-6 m-push-m-3

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [picking]
            :end-before: [/picking]

There's also a new experimental :dox:`DartIntegration` library being worked on
--- it integrates the `DART Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit <https://dartsim.github.io/>`_
into Magnum in a similar way that's done with the Bullet Physics library. A
first draft is already merged with second revision being currently in the
works. This library alone deserves a blog post on its own --- stay tuned!

`Upgrading from previous versions`_
===================================

Because there was no milestone since 2015, great care was taken to maintain
backwards compatibility with the 2015.05 version. Depending on how big your
upgrade jump is, upgrading to 2018.02 should be largely source compatible, with
deprecation warnings issued for APIs that were replaced with new functionality.

In contrast, immediately following this release there's some cleanup work
scheduled --- purging of APIs deprecated for a long time and doing some
reorganization to make space for new features, such as Vulkan and SPIR-V
support.

`Complete changelog`_
=====================

If you survived all the way down here, congrats! There's much more and it's not
possible to fit everything in this announcement. You can find a detailed list
of changes in version 2018.02 in the documentation:
