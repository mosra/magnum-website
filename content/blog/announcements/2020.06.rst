Big reworks take time to ferment properly, which is why this release comes more
than six months after the previous one, `2019.10 <{filename}2019.10.rst>`_. I
dare to say this is the busiest release of Magnum yet, with work spanning
across several areas of the project. Following are release highlights, for a
detailed changelog that's about 100 times bigger please see
`links at the bottom <#full-changelog>`_.

`New geometry pipeline`_
========================

Asset import and geometry processing is one of the central parts of Magnum. For
2020.06 it got rewritten from a rather basic decade-old "toy engine"
implementation full of nested :dox:`std::vector`\ s to an efficient and
flexible GPU-friendly design that's ready for new paradigms such as mesh
shaders. I won't be reiterating everything that went into it again in this
announcement, please go see the in-depth introduction article for detailed
information:

            `New Geometry Pipeline in Magnum <{filename}new-geometry-pipeline.rst>`_ :label-flat-info:`May 27, 2020`

            Flexible and efficient mesh representation, custom attributes, new
            data types and a ton of new processing, visualization and analyzing
            tools. GPU-friendly geometry storage as it should be in the 21st century.

`Let's fork C++ further`_
=========================

The move away from :dox:`std::vector`, which is visible especially in the
redesigned :dox:`MeshTools` namespace, means Magnum had to provide a
replacement. :dox:`Containers::Array` is around for quite a while --- but for
the purpose of certain importers and :dox:`Primitives` that can't easily know
the final index/vertex count beforehand --- it had to be extended to support
arbitrary growing, like :dox:`std::vector` has.

.. container:: m-col-m-6 m-center-m

    .. code-figure::

        .. code:: c++

            Containers::Array<Color3> palette;

            arrayAppend<MyFancyAllocator>(palette, {
                0xa5c9ea_rgbf,
                0x3bd267_rgbf,
                0xc7cf2f_rgbf
            });

        .. class:: m-text m-small m-noindent

        A :dox:`Containers::Array` instance isn't tied to a particular
        allocator --- and you can also switch to a different allocator at any point later.

The design is rather unconventional in order to avoid the well-known
shortcomings of :dox:`std::vector`, especially when it comes to custom
allocators. The implementation present in 2020.06 is still missing arbitrary
insertion and deletion which is why it's not advertised in more detail yet ---
once that's done, expect a dedicated article together with benchmarks and
comparison to common implementations. Until then, see
:dox:`Containers-Array-growable` for an introduction.

One of the last remaining pieces of STL that are :s:`holding us back` not as
lightweight & flexible as I'd want them to be are :dox:`std::string`\ s. After
the release cut I decided that new APIs are not going to use those anymore,
which means a replacement is underway. Existing APIs will get gradually ported
away, similarly as was done with :dox:`std::vector` or :dox:`std::unique_ptr`
in the past. Of course, as always, an *opt-in* compatibility of the new APIs
with :dox:`std::string` / :dox:`std::string_view` will be provided --- the goal
is not to alienate users of standard C++, the goal is to be flexible and
provide alternatives.

`Math and algorithm goodies`_
=============================

Because the new :dox:`Trade::MeshData` APIs expanded a lot on supported vertex
formats, the math library received batch :dox:`Math::packInto()` /
:dox:`unpackInto() <Math::unpackInto()>` functions that allow for efficient
conversion between floating-point and 8-/16-bit packed or half-float types.
When no conversion is needed, :dox:`Utility::copy()` from a new
:dox:`Utility/Algorithms.h </home/mosra/Code/corrade/src/Corrade/Utility/Algorithms.h>`
header gives you a :dox:`std::memcpy()` / :dox:`std::copy()` alternative that
works on multiple dimensions and sparse data layouts as well.

.. container:: m-col-m-8 m-center-m

    .. code-figure::

        .. code:: c++

            ImageView2D src, dst;

            Utility::copy(src.pixels().flipped<1>(), dst.pixels());

        .. class:: m-text m-small m-noindent

        Mirroring an image --- in an oneliner, with
        :dox:`Containers::StridedArrayView` underneath.

The :dox:`MeshTools` library, apart from being adapted for the redesigned
workflow, now contains :dox:`MeshTools::concatenate()` for joining multiple
meshes together, or for example :dox:`MeshTools::generateIndices()` for
converting strips, loops or fans to plain indexed meshes.

`What's new in plugins`_
========================

The more Magnum gets used to import a increasingly broad range of datasets in
various formats, the more previously unhandled corner cases get discovered and
fixed.

-   The :dox:`AssimpImporter <Trade::AssimpImporter>` now correctly imports
    multi-primitive meshes, preserves alpha in materials and accounts for Y up
    / Z up orientation override, if a file defines it.
-   All importers now import both base color and texture instead of either one
    or the other. Interestingly, this was a limitation that originated from the
    COLLADA format --- the early :dox:`Trade` APIs and the now-gone
    ``ColladaImporter`` plugin were modelled after it, however when reviewing
    this design decision it turned out that COLLADA is actually the only format
    with such restriction and every other format (OBJ, glTF, OpenGEX, ...)
    supports combining both.
-   :dox:`TinyGltfImporter <Trade::TinyGltfImporter>` failed to import
    interleaved meshes. This was a shortcut done to make the early
    implementation simpler. To my surprise, apparently the vast majority of
    glTF models is exported de-interleaved and thus inefficient for the GPU,
    which explains why this limitation went largely unnoticed since the
    original plugin release in 2018.

Image importers weren't left behind either --- formats that support it such as
DDS or Basis Universal now can import particular mip levels using
:dox:`Trade::AbstractImporter::image2DLevelCount()` and the second parameter of
:dox:`Trade::AbstractImporter::image2D()`, with this being proxied into all
scene importers as well. Vaguely related to this, :dox:`DevIlImageImporter <Trade::DevIlImageImporter>`
and :dox:`StbImageImporter <Trade::StbImageImporter>` can now import frames of
animated GIFs for a very crude :dox:`video playback <examples-animated-gif>`.

.. container:: m-right-m m-col-m-6 m-container-inflate

    .. figure:: {static}/img/blog/announcements/2020.06/primitives.png

        ..

        Suited mainly for testing purposes, the whole :dox:`Primitives` library
        is now exposed through a :dox:`PrimitiveImporter <Trade::PrimitiveImporter>`
        plugin. This can be used for example to expose builtin primitives to
        existing ``Importer``-based pipelines without having to add new code
        path for each.

As mentioned in the `New Geometry Pipeline in Magnum <{filename}new-geometry-pipeline.rst>`_
article already, there's several additions and improvements that go together
with the new :dox:`Trade::MeshData` APIs:

-   :dox:`AssimpImporter <Trade::AssimpImporter>` and
    :dox:`TinyGltfImporter <Trade::TinyGltfImporter>` now import tangents /
    bitangents as well, with support for skinning attributes getting ready in
    :gh:`mosra/magnum#441`
-   :dox:`StanfordImporter <Trade::StanfordImporter>` for the PLY file format
    got extended to support normals, texture coordinates, vertex colors and
    per-face attributes, being also highly optimized for near-instant import
    times
-   :dox:`TinyGltfImporter <Trade::TinyGltfImporter>` and
    :dox:`StanfordImporter <Trade::StanfordImporter>` now recognize a
    per-vertex Object ID attribute, used in various datasets for semantic
    annotations. Because it isn't standardized in any way and each dataset
    might use it differently, the :ini:`objectIdAttribute`
    :dox:`plugin-specific configuration option <Trade-TinyGltfImporter-configuration>`
    can be used to recognize it under a different name.
-   :dox:`TinyGltfImporter <Trade::TinyGltfImporter>` received support for
    several new extensions including `KHR_lights_punctual <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_lights_punctual>`_,
    `KHR_texture_transform <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_transform>`_
    and `KHR_mesh_quantization <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization/README.md>`_

Finally, there is a new scene converter plugin interface, with
:dox:`MeshOptimizerSceneConverter <Trade::MeshOptimizerSceneConverter>` and
:dox:`StanfordSceneConverter <Trade::StanfordSceneConverter>` being the first
two plugins implementing it. Apart from that, image importers now have a simple
:dox:`IcoImporter <Trade::IcoImporter>` for Windows ``*.ico`` files and there's
(also a very trivial) :dox:`StlImporter <Trade::StlImporter>` for binary STL
files, commonly used in 3D printing.

All importer and converter plugins received a flag to enable verbose output,
which is also exposed as a ``--verbose`` option in the
:dox:`magnum-imageconverter <magnum-imageconverter>`,
:dox:`magnum-sceneconverter <magnum-sceneconverter>` and
:dox:`magnum-player <magnum-player>` utilities. The plugins use that to notify
you about longer-running operations or processing stats. It's probably most
helpful in case of Assimp, which likes to crash or misbehave on certain files.

`Builtin shader improvements, new visualization tools`_
=======================================================

Perhaps the most significant shader addition is instancing support in
:dox:`Shaders::Phong` and :dox:`Shaders::Flat` --- while instancing alone was
supported in the :dox:`GL` library since 2014, the builtin shaders didn't
implement this functionality until now. For showcase, the :dox:`examples-bullet`
and :dox:`examples-box2d` examples are now reimplemented using instancing, each
of them using just a single draw call for the whole scene. Try them out online:

.. container:: m-row m-container-inflate

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [box2d]
            :end-before: [/box2d]

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [bullet]
            :end-before: [/bullet]

Complementing the glTF `KHR_texture_transform`_ extension support, there's now
:dox:`Shaders::Phong::setTextureMatrix()` together with ability to have
instanced texture offset, and the same in :dox:`Shaders::Flat`.

With tangent and normal map import being done, :dox:`Shaders::Phong` normal
map support added in 2019.10 can finally be fully utilized. This is closely
tied with :dox:`Shaders::MeshVisualizer3D` now being able to visualize not just
wireframe but also tangent, bitangent and normal direction --- very useful for
debugging those dreaded lighting issues.

.. image:: {static}/img/blog/announcements/2020.06/meshvisualizer3d.png
    :scale: 50%

:dox:`Shaders::Phong` / :dox:`Shaders::Flat` can now output also per-vertex
Object ID attribute, which means :dox:`Shaders::MeshVisualizer3D` can visualize
that one as well, together with vertex and primitive ID. This goes hand-in-hand
with a new :dox:`DebugTools::ColorMap` namespace that includes also the
`very recognizable Turbo colormap <https://twitter.com/antovsky/status/1265711996718080001>`_
by Anton Mikhailov.

`Certain GL drivers continue to be a hot mess`_
===============================================

Even if all other new features shown here wouldn't be a convincing reason for
you to upgrade, you'll definitely want to pick up these three workarounds for
better driver compatibility:

.. container:: m-col-m-4 m-right-m m-container-inflate

    .. note-danger:: Beware: Intel drivers

        Unlike most workarounds where the engine fully shields you from driver
        bugs, broken :glsl:`layout(location=N)` on Intel Windows drivers
        affects you as well --- think twice before using explicit uniform locations if you need to support Intel GPUs on Windows. Even though it
        makes the shader code simpler, the frustrating debugging experience
        afterwards is not worth it.

-   A hard-to-reproduce :abbr:`synchronization <or I assume so>` bug on Intel
    Windows drivers makes the :glext:`ARB_direct_state_access` extension
    basically unusable for anything related to buffers or VAOs. Usually
    manifested as flickering in ImGui-based apps. A subset of this workaround
    was done for 2019.10 already but due to its semi-random nature it didn't
    cover all cases. This workaround abandonds all hope and completely disables
    DSA for affected code paths on these drivers.

-   Intel Windows drivers don't really respect explicit uniform locations but
    instead only take it as a very vague suggestion. This bug was most
    certainly `also present since forever <https://twitter.com/czmosra/status/1106955396219105285>`_,
    but only became visible after the latest additions of texture transform,
    normal maps and instancing to builtin shaders, which caused the uniform
    locations to be anything but a contiguous increasing sequence. Since
    there's no apparent rhyme or reason in which the drivers allocate uniform
    IDs, solution was to disable the :glext:`ARB_explicit_uniform_location` on
    Intel Windows drivers altogether.

-   It's hard to find bugs in drivers that are capable of very little, but even
    then --- while this bug was probably present ever since Apple rewrote their
    (deprecated) GL 4.1 driver on top of Metal, it got independently discovered
    by two different users only recently. When :dox:`GL::BufferTexture` is
    bound, it causes all buffer modifications to crash due to what I assume is
    corruption of internal driver state. The workaround avoids the crash by
    unbinding the texture when updating or mapping a :dox:`GL::Buffer`.

For your amusement, the list of all current OpenGL driver workarounds is
:dox:`in the documentation <opengl-workarounds>`.

`But there are also some non-negative GL news, even`_
=====================================================

.. container:: m-col-m-5 m-left-m m-container-inflate

    .. console-figure::

        .. include:: 2020.06/debugtools-frameprofiler.ansi
            :code: ansi

        .. class:: m-text m-small m-noindent

        An example where pipeline statistic queries can be useful. Output from
        :dox:`DebugTools::FrameProfiler`.

Working on the geometry pipeline and large datasets required me to do various
measurements, which led to a new :dox:`GL::PipelineStatisticsQuery` class. It
exposes the :glext:`ARB_pipeline_statistics_query` extension which doesn't
provide *really* much, but it's at least something --- and sadly the only
non-proprietary way to get *any* stats on NVidia drivers. A new
:dox:`DebugTools::FrameProfiler` class uses those queries to give you a
easy-to-integrate per-frame profiling.

Apart from that, various tiny bits and pieces such as
:dox:`clipping plane support <GL::Renderer::Feature::ClipDistance0>` were
added, mostly on-demand based on needs of various users. See the changelog
links at the bottom for the full list.

One quite minor but widely appreciated change was turning :cpp:`mesh.draw(shader)`
into :cpp:`shader.draw(mesh)`. The original was a result of how the API evolved
over the years, which is why I was blind to its counterintuitiveness until it
was finally pointed out to me. A good takeaway from that is --- if you see
anything in Magnum APIs that feels strange or unnecessarily complicated, please
complain, no matter how "noob" or inexperienced you might feel. Feedback like
this matters a lot, and if I never hear it, I might never discover the problem.

One interesting project that is making great progress recently is Mesa's Zink
OpenGL-over-Vulkan driver. Stable Mesa 20.1 doesn't have it enabled by default
yet and there it's just at GL 2.1, but latest commits already
`bring it up to 3.1 support <http://www.supergoodcode.com/opengl-3.1/>`_. After
fixing some bad assumptions in context creation routines in order to make pure
GL 2.1 contexts work again, Magnum can now work with Zink as well.

.. note-success::

    If you want to try Zink, you have to compile Mesa from sources. If you are
    on ArchLinux, easiest is to take the AUR
    `mesa-git <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mesa-git/>`_ package and
    add ``zink`` to the ``-D gallium-drivers`` list. Alternatively, if you
    don't want to play with fire *that much*, modify the
    `stable package <https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk?h=packages/mesa>`_
    instead.

`Application improvements`_
===========================

Thanks to a joint effort from several contributors,
:dox:`Platform::GlfwApplication` and :dox:`Platform::Sdl2Application` now
support cursor management, which is also used by the :dox:`ImGuiIntegration`
library. Both applications can now also set window icon, and if you are on
Windows, you can use it together with the new :dox:`IcoImporter <Trade::IcoImporter>`
to use one file to set an :dox:`executable icon <platform-windows-icon>` and a
window icon as well, optionally also providing several resolutions to let the
OS choose from.

The :dox:`ImGuiIntegration` library was switched to use builtin
:dox:`Shaders::Flat2D` instead of a custom shader, which removed quite some
code *and* made it work on WebGL 1 as well. This was possible thanks to builtin
shaders receiving vertex color support in the 2019.10 release.

Windowless apps, which are commonly used for data processing or testing, got
extended to support context sharing. The :dox:`Platform::WindowlessEglApplication`
supports EGL device selection through the ``--magnum-device`` option since
2019.10 and now it supports also ``--magnum-cuda-device`` for filtering only
CUDA devices, if you're running on a machine with NVidia GPUs.

If you don't use the builtin application wrappers, there's a new
:gh:`base-gtkmm <mosra/magnum-bootstrap$base-gtkmm>` bootstrap project to get
you started using GTKmm, joining :gh:`base-wxwidgets <mosra/magnum-bootstrap$base-wxwidgets>`
added in the previous release, and with a QtQuick bootstrap being worked on
for the next.

`A gigaton of cool new examples`_
=================================

The *Contributor of the Year* award goes to :gh:`Nghia Truong <ttnghia>` ---
submitting five extremely interesting examples, each implementing a different
algorithm completely from scratch, with many more goodies promised. All of them
are now available as WebGL demos, feel free to try them out:

.. container:: m-row m-container-inflate

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [fluidsimulation2d]
            :end-before: [/fluidsimulation2d]

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [fluidsimulation3d]
            :end-before: [/fluidsimulation3d]

    .. container:: m-clearfix-m

        ..

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [raytracing]
            :end-before: [/raytracing]

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [octree]
            :end-before: [/octree]

    .. container:: m-clearfix-m

        ..

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [arcball]
            :end-before: [/arcball]

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. include:: ../../showcase-figures.rst.in
            :start-after: [webxr]
            :end-before: [/webxr]

Apart from these, the original WebVR API got obsoleted by WebXR, and so follows
our example, linked above --- currently you can try it out in Chrome, and it
also works in the Android browser.

`Buildsystem improvements`_
===========================

`Clang-CL <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-msbuild?view=vs-2019>`_
is now an officially supported and tested compiler, in case you want to build
for Windows but :s:`hate both` neither MinGW nor MSVC suits your needs. Some
work was done for MinGW Clang support but
:gh:`serious untackled issues <mosra/magnum#439>` still remain, so GCC is still
the only supported compiler under MinGW.

Because dependency management is hard unless you have a system-wide package
manager or :gh:`Vcpkg <microsoft/vcpkg>` doing the work for you, certain
dependencies such as OpenAL, Basis Universal, meshoptimizer or ImGui can now
be bundled as CMake subprojects. In addition, various fixes were done in CMake
Find modules for statically-linked dependencies that are commonly used when
distributing project binaries.

To better track versions of your dependencies, all Magnum projects now contain
a ``version.h`` header containing the exact commit the library was built from.

Builtin CMake Android support, which got broken with the introduction of NDK
r19, is working with CMake 3.16+ again, only with
:abbr:`minimal workarounds <it's Android, don't expect things to "just work">`.
Building documentation and the :dox:`Android troubleshooting guide <platforms-android>`
were updated to reflect this fact.

`New and improved tools`_
=========================

Going with the new :dox:`Trade::AbstractSceneConverter` plugin interface,
there's a :dox:`magnum-sceneconverter <magnum-sceneconverter>` utility as well.
Currently the only supported output is PLY (through :dox:`StanfordSceneConverter <Trade::StanfordSceneConverter>`)
and the amount of operations is limited, but this area is going to expand over
time, like it did for image conversion plugins. In addition the tool also
exposes various :dox:`MeshTools` algorithms such as duplicate removal or
attribute filtering.

:dox:`magnum-imageconverter <magnum-imageconverter>` can now
consume and produce raw pixel data of a specified format, which is useful when
dealing with low-level pipelines that don't understand high-level image
container formats. For data diagnostic and debugging, both
:dox:`magnum-imageconverter <magnum-imageconverter>` and
:dox:`magnum-sceneconverter <magnum-sceneconverter>` learned a new ``--info``
option that prints information about file contents, pixel / vertex formats and
data layout.

The :dox:`magnum-player <magnum-player>` utility is heavily used for internal
testing and thus absorbed basically all new engine additions --- it can display
normal maps, exposes all visualization features of :dox:`Shaders::MeshVisualizer3D` and you can run :dox:`DebugTools::FrameProfiler`
with the :label-default:`P` key. Only the native app has the new additions
right now, the web version wasn't updated yet.

`Full changelog`_
=================

There's so much happening that this article is, as always, just a distilled
version of the changelog --- and I'm sure I forgot to mention some of the
hidden gems:

-   :dox:`Changes in Corrade 2020.06 <corrade-changelog-2020-06>`
-   :dox:`Changes in Magnum 2020.06 <changelog-2020-06>`
-   :dox:`Changes in Magnum Plugins 2020.06 <changelog-plugins-2020-06>`
-   :dox:`Changes in Magnum Integration 2020.06 <changelog-integration-2020-06>`
-   :dox:`Changes in Magnum Extras 2020.06 <changelog-extras-2020-06>`
-   :dox:`Changes in Magnum Examples 2020.06 <changelog-examples-2020-06>`

`Updating from previous versions`_
==================================

If you use :gh:`Homebrew <mosra/homebrew-magnum>`,
`ArchLinux AUR <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=magnum>`_ or build
your own ``*.deb`` packages, the 2020.06 release is already available there.
Vcpkg package update is currently waiting for a merge in
:gh:`microsoft/vcpkg#12211`, MSYS packages are almost ready in
:gh:`msys2/MINGW-packages#6641` and ArchLinux community package updates will
follow shortly. If you use :gh:`Magnum Singles <mosra/magnum-singles>`, those
have all additions from 2020.06 present.

If you have your code already using the new :dox:`Trade::MeshData` APIs,
congrats --- you're 95% there. If not, the new release should *mostly* compile
with your existing code, only emit a lot of deprecation warnings where each
will tell you what API to use instead.

.. block-warning:: Breaking changes

    While Magnum tries to avoid breaking changes if possible, sometimes it's
    inevitable, and those are the major ones that might bite you:

    -   Predefined locations of generic mesh attributes --- in particular
        normals, tangents and colors --- got changed in order to accomodate for
        new attribute types . This may break custom shaders if these rely on
        generic attribute definitions or are used together with :dox:`MeshTools::compile()`. To avoid such breakages, you're advised to
        propagate the generic definitions to the shader code as shown in the
        :dox:`Shaders::Generic <Shaders-Generic-custom>` documentation.
    -   :dox:`CORRADE_ASSERT_UNREACHABLE()` got renamed to
        :dox:`CORRADE_INTERNAL_ASSERT_UNREACHABLE()` and the original name is
        reused for a macro with a custom error message. If you were not using
        Corrade asserts in your code, this change won't affect you, otherwise
        you'll get a compilation error and need to adapt.
    -   :dox:`ResourceManager` :cpp:`instance()` singleton that got deprecated
        in 2019.10 had to be fully removed. Usually a deprecated API is kept
        for at least a year to give everyone enough time to upgrade, but here
        it was severely limiting multithreaded applications and so it's gone
        earlier.
