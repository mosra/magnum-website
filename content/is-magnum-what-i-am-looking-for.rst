        .. block-success:: Hobby game developer

            *"I want to make a small game and learn principles of computer
            graphics and multiplatform development along the way."*

            .. class:: m-text m-dim

            Magnum has a thin GPU abstraction and well-documented APIs for
            exploring the concepts behind vector math and 3D graphics.

            *"I'm working on a paper about physically-based rendering and need
            to accompany it with a demo, running on desktop platforms and web."*

            *"I got a game idea and want to make it real. I'm a pretty good
            artist and I'm looking for something easy-to-grasp to quickly
            iterate on visuals and gameplay."*

            Magnum requires proficiency in C++ and provides building blocks
            that you need to put together. A WYSIWYG engine with an editor and
            scripting may be a better fit for you.
