            *Lightweight and modular C++11/C++14 graphics middleware for games
            and data visualization.*

            Looking for an open-source library that gives you graphics
            abstraction and platform independence on major desktop, mobile and
            web platforms? Do you want it to have all the convenience utilities
            around yet stay small, powerful and not give up on flexibility?
            *Here it is.* And it's :abbr:`free to use <Licensed under MIT>`,
            even for commercial purposes.

        .. block-primary:: Beauty of *simplicity*

            Among Magnum essentials is a UTF-8-aware OS, filesystem and console
            abstraction, a versatile vector math library and a slim C++11
            wrapper of Vulkan and OpenGL API families. Build on top of that or
            opt-in for more.

            and automatic testing, asset management, integration with popular
            windowing toolkits and a UI library. Everything fits together but
            you still have a choice.

            There's always more than one way to do things. Enjoy the freedom of
            choice and integrate your own asset loader, texture compressor,
            font format or math library, if you feel the need. Or use any of
            the various plugins.
